              %p It all started over sausages and beers (as all wonderful things should). Jeffrey and Anna met at Gestalt Haus while out with a mutual friend in the Mission. Initial conversation included UC Santa Cruz, where they both went to school (they never met during that time, however), as well as music &mdash; Anna had seen Jeffrey's sister's band play when they were performing around SF circa 2006.
              %p Nothing after that was particularly deliberate. In an effort to go see more live shows and see more friends in the process, Anna started creating Facebook events for different shows, inviting people to come along. Jeffrey, in an effort to meet more people upon moving to SF, accepted every invite he could attend. From there, something slowly but surely clicked. Their first date was at Fly Bar in Divisidero, followed by the Tallest Man on Earth at the Independent (he's actually not that tall in real life, but he makes excellent music).
              %p Jeffrey had recently moved into the city with new job prospects. He had come from his dad's place in San Rafael, where he was staying after realizing grad school in Seattle wasn't for him. In early 2009, he found a pleasant space in a not-so-pleasant neighborhood, and spent his free time exploring the city with his new Internet friends.
              %p Anna moved to SF in late 2008, after living in Berkeley and Oakland the previous three years. She originally moved to the East Bay after graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 2005 and securing a job at UC Berkeley. While her first apartment in SF was in a less desirable location (with an evil landlord, to boot), her housemates were fantastic.
              %p Shortly after they started dating, Anna's upstairs neighbors left the toilet running and her aforementioned crummy apartment was soon deluged; she and her housemates were left temporarily homeless and Anna was scheduled to stay with her parents for the time being. One evening, Anna was about to head to her parents' house, but her car was stuck behind another in her shared garage. She had the keys, but she had no idea how to drive a manual transmission Saab. Taking a page out of the Matrix, Jeffrey looked up instructions on how to drive a stick on his iPhone and downloaded them into his brain. After a stall or two, the car was moved and Anna could go along her way.
              %p
                Jeffrey helped Anna move into a nice new place with her housemates on the other side of the Mission, right next to SF General Hospital. This came in handy when Jeffrey smashed his shoulder into Market Street after getting hit by a car on his bike. Anna rushed to his rescue and brought him to bed (across the street). Anna's apartment was great for other, less
                painful reasons &mdash; there was a gorgeous cat, awesome landlords, and plenty of bright space to hold a series of puzzle parties, which are just what they sound like &mdash; parties where friends came over and solved #{link_to "one ridiculously challenging puzzle", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=727747356368", :target => "_blank"}.

              %p They traveled Europe in late 2010 &mdash;  London, Paris, the Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome, Berlin, Amsterdam &mdash; all within two-and-a-half weeks. Needless to say, it was spectacular. You can read all about it in the #{link_to "Updates section", "#updates"}!
              %p
                Jeffrey moved in with Anna in 2011. The rest of the year was filled with travels &mdash; to Austin for SxSW, New Jersey to see Anna's family, and New York to see Jeffrey's. After a year of new sights and sounds, they finished the year off on Treasure Island, surrounded by friends and a beautiful panorama of the city where they had started their life. As the New Year's fireworks shot into the sky, Jeffrey took out the engagement ring, promptly dropped it, fumbled around in the dark, and
                presented it to Anna.
              %p In early 2012, they moved into an apartment in Hayes Valley with a beautiful overlook of their city. They adopted Backup, an orange, noisy, lovable menace. They've been settling into their newly engaged life, but they can't wait until 2013, when they'll be married in their city among family and friends!

              %p
                Anna was born in New Jersey, but her family moved to Northern California before she could truly call herself a "Jersey girl." The subsequent coming-of-age years in Sebastopol revolved around volleyball, Gravenstein apples and a high school located next to a dairy farm.
              %p
                Thus far, her adult life has been a love letter to the University of California: she spent four awesome years in the majestic redwood forest of UC Santa Cruz, and she has worked at UC Berkeley ever since she graduated. She started working in student affairs before transitioning into web editing and communications for a less student-centric department; currently, she gets to work on high-profile university websites, plus she gets to use the word "Specialist" in her payroll title!
              %p
                After entering the post-college world, Anna discovered a love for independent music, which later developed into a specific focus on Bay Area-based bands and artists. Her involvement with several local music blogs outside of work led to a part-time gig with #{link_to "the Bay Bridged", "http://www.thebaybridged.com/", :target => "_blank"}, a local music website and non-profit, where she assists with blog and event production.
              %p
                In her spare time, Anna also enjoys cooking/baking, reading, spending time with friends and family, swimming, running, and simply walking around San Francisco.

              %p
                Jeffrey grew up in the Bay Area. Born in Fremont and growing up in San
                Rafael, he spent his youth drawing comics. In fact, he drew everything
                on this site!
              %p
                He became enamored with the web early on &mdash; he made his first website
                in 1994. He's been constantly making them ever since, and lucky for
                him, it's an important tool of the trade in San Francisco.
              %p
                He also loves video games, especially platformers and music games. He
                kept in shape throughout high school and college by playing Dance
                Dance Revolution. He's now more focused on long-distance running, but
                he's always got time for a trip to the arcade.
              %p
                From his apartment in Hayes Valley, Jeffrey bikes down Market Street
                to work on the Embarcadero every day. He also bikes to #{link_to "Noisebridge", "https://noisebridge.net", :target => "_blank"}, a
                local hackerspace, where he teaches a free class on frontend web
                development.

                We've lived in San Francisco for as long as we've known each other. We
                love the city and its many neighborhoods &mdash; the Tenderloin, Mission,
                Potrero Hill and Hayes Valley being the sites of our many homes &mdash; and
                enjoy making the most of it from the bay to the breakers.
              %h2 Destinations
              %p
                If you're visiting San Francisco, there are the obvious sights and
                sounds.
              %p
                Your first vacation shouldn't be complete without a walk along
                the Embarcadero from the
                %b Ferry Building
                to <b>Fisherman's Wharf</b>. Along the walk, you'll come across
                the <b>Exploratorium</b>, a unique science museum that recently
                made Pier 15 its home, <b>Pier 38</b>, a maritime shopping center,
                and <b>Musée Mécanique</b>, Pier 45's arcade game museum.
              %p
                A hike up the nearby Telegraph Hill to <b>Coit Tower</b> will
                give you a great view of downtown.
              %p
                A walk along the
                %b Golden Gate Bridge
                can provide spectacular views of the north
                bay when it's not fogged over. Dress warmly just in case!
              %p
                Of course, there are many attractions that are off the beaten path.
                Our neighborhood, <b>Hayes Valley</b>, and the adjoining
                %b Mission district
                are full of cute shops, delicious food, and parks with a view.
                <b>Dolores Park</b>, in particular, is a major attraction for
                the age 20-30 crowd. For a great day in the park, get food and
                drinks at nearby <b>Rhea's Deli</b> or <b>Bi-Rite Market</b>.
                Move higher up for the best views. Just be discreet with
                alcoholic beverages. There's a fantastic playground for children
                as well.
              %p
                If you're looking to hike the many hills of our city,
                <b>Bernal Hill</b> and <b>Twin Peaks</b> provide short
                expeditions with great visual payoffs. <b>Mount Sutro</b>
                provides a lovely hike through a lush forest with ocean views.
              %h2 Restaurants
              %p
                Some might think that the official food of San Francisco is
                clam chowder in a bread bowl, but they'd be wrong &mdash; it's
                definitely the super burrito, invented right in the Mission.
                Head to <b>Taqueria Cancún</b> or <b>El Farolito</b> for what
                most (not all) consider to be the best of the bunch.
              %p
                The sandwiches at <b>Ike's Place</b> and the aforementioned
                <b>Rhea's</b> are so popular that it's often best to check out
                their menus online and call ahead.
              %p
                Food trucks are essentially haute fast food, and San Francisco's
                got them in spades. In addition to the <b>Off the Grid</b>
                pop-ups throughout the city, there's <b>SOMA StrEAT Food
                Park</b>, a snazzy setup which has a constantly rotating cast of

                For a great dinner date, there's <b>Starbelly</b>, a new
                American restaurant with some fancy pizzas, among other things.
                <b>Tangerine</b> is our
                favorite Asian fusion spot. <b>Lolinda</b> and <b>Destino</b>
                have delicious South American small plates &mdash; their meat
                options are not to be missed.

                If you're really looking to splurge, there's <b>Gary Danko</b>
                and <b>Michael Mina</b>, two treasures with creative menus and
                drinks, and <b>Aziza</b> with a Moroccan-inspired menu. Consider
                reserving far ahead of time for these fancier options.

                Trust us: while we might not be on the east coast, our pizza is
                definitely worth a try. Go to <b>Pauline's</b>, which also
                serves their own wine, <b>Little Star</b> for deep dish with a
                cornmeal crust, or <b>Patxi</b>'s if the former is too crowded.

                %b Lahore Karahi
                is our favorite Indian/Pakistani place, and
                %b Mandalay
                serves great Burmese food. If you've never tried Burmese food,
                we think it combines the best of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese
                cooking.

              %p
                <b>Magnolia Pub</b> and <b>Monk's Kettle</b> are the go-to
                places for great beer selections along with some delectable pub
                food. <b>Toronado</b> also has a wide variety of beers, and
                sausages next door at <b>Rosamunde</b> make the night complete.
              %p

                Looking for ice cream? Head to <b>Humphry Slocombe</b> for some
                strange but surprisingly tasty flavors. <b>Bi-Rite</b> also has
                some of the best scoops around, if you can bear the line.
                <b>Smitten</b>'s ice cream is churned using dry ice, making it
                exceptionally smooth.
              %p
                Cupcakes are especially hip. Try <b>Kara's Cupcakes</b>, in
                truck or storefront form. And if you can't wait for our wedding,
                visit <b>Sift Cupcakes</b> for some of the moistest ones we've
                ever had.
              %p
                Finally, try to catch the <b>Crème Brûlée Cart</b> if you can.
                And if you're looking for an upscale twist on a traditional
                candy shop, don't miss <b>Miette</b>.

                From Hayes Valley, you can rent bikes and ride to Golden Gate
                Park along the <b>Wiggle</b>, a popular route that avoids most
                of the hills. Or if you're looking to indulge in the arts, see
                a show at the <b>SFJAZZ Center</b>.
              %p
                There are numerous great restaurants along Hayes or Gough
                Street, but especially worth mention are <b>Suppenkuche</b>, a
                German joint, <b>Lers Ros</b> for fancy Thai cuisine, and
                <b>Sauce</b>, whose menu has some interesting twists on the
                classics.
              %p
                Finally, go for some drinks. Try <b>Two Sisters</b>, <b>Place
                Pigalle</b>, or head to the <b>Biergarten</b>, an outdoor venue
                with large pours and warm pretzels.
